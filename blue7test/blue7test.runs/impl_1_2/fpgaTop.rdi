Running DRC as a precondition to command write_bitstream
ERROR: [Drc 23-20] Rule violation (IOSTDTYPE-1) IOStandard Type - I/O port sys0_clkn is Single-Ended but has an IOStandard of LVDS which can only support Differential
ERROR: [Drc 23-20] Rule violation (IOSTDTYPE-1) IOStandard Type - I/O port sys0_clkp is Single-Ended but has an IOStandard of LVDS which can only support Differential
ERROR: [Drc 23-20] Rule violation (NSTD-1) Unspecified I/O Standard - 2 out of 30 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use set_property BITSTREAM.General.UnconstrainedPins {Allow} on the current design. Problem ports: sys1_clkn, sys1_clkp.
ERROR: [Vivado 12-1345] Error(s) found during DRC. Bitgen not run.
