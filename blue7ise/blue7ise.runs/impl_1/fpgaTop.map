WARNING:LIT:701 - PAD symbol "sys1_clkp" has an undefined IOSTANDARD.
Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal gmii_rx_clk connected to top level port gmii_rx_clk
   has been removed.
WARNING:MapLib:41 - All members of TNM group "GMII_RX_CLK" have been optimized
   out of the design.
WARNING:MapLib:50 - The period specification "TS_GMII_RX_CLK" has been discarded
   because the group "GMII_RX_CLK" has been optimized away.
Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:2949 - The I/O component sys0_clkn uses an DQS_BIAS attribute with
   I/O standard LVDS. The DQS_BIAS attribute will be ignored since the selected
   I/O standard does not support DQS_BIAS usage.
WARNING:Pack:2949 - The I/O component sys0_clkp uses an DQS_BIAS attribute with

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
