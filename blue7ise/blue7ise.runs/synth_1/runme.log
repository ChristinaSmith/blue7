Building and optimizing final netlist ...
Found area constraint ratio of 100 (+ 0) on block fpgaTop, actual ratio is 0.
FlipFlop ftop/sys1_rst/reset_hold_0 has been replicated 1 time(s) to handle iob=true attribute.

Final Macro Processing ...

Processing Unit <fpgaTop> :
INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 16-bit shift register was found for signal <ftop/sys0_rst/reset_hold_15> and currently occupies 16 logic cells (8 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
Unit <fpgaTop> processed.
